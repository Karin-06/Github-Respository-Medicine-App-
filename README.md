# Medicine Web App
# The purpose of the project is to create a web app that is user-friendly. Analyzing the Drug Facts of the store-bought medicine and implementing customization features as well as drug interaction checks. 
# I originally wanted the project to be done with medication label analysis and customization features to be done by the middle of the semester and work on the medicine interaction checker in the other half. 
# I am going to use a Windows computer to make this project as well as a Framework of Streamlit and Visual Studio code to write the actual code.
